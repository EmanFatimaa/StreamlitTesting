    ## The Objective of Our Khidmat Project

    The objective of our Khidmat project is to develop a comprehensive database system for Paws Rescue's: Shelter Management System (SMS), designed to streamline their animal rescue and care facility's operations. This database will serve as a centralized platform for managing critical aspects of shelter management, including treatment logs, animal monitoring, inventory management, and patient data. 

    By implementing this database, we aim to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of our shelter operations, ultimately improving animal health and welfare, operational efficiency, resource management, and overall shelter effectiveness. 

    This project will significantly bolster our mission to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome cats, ensuring that each animal receives the highest standard of care.
